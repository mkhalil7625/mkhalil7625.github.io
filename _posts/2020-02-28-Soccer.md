## FIFA 19 Data Analysis
FIFA 19 is a soccerball simulation video game developed by EA. EA does a great job on making the video game mimics the game in real life. 
As the data collected by EA in the video game is based on real life data analysys let's determine the best soccer team Using data from Kaggle's [FIFA 19 Dataset](https://kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19)

### Top Ten Teams
Let's take a look at the top ten teams based on overall quality of their players(quality is reated from 0 to 100), the net value and the total weekly salary.
To do so, let's first extract the correct values from the value and salary coulmns:

After converting those string values and getting the actual values, let's see the top 10 teams based on the quality of their players along with the net value of each team and the weekly wages paid.

**Note:** Most teams will add some players from their youth team to the professional team; that  is why I calculated the median of the Ovaerall quality of the plyers.

### Superstar Players
Analyzing the top team's data against the top ten ranked players, shows that Real Madrid have 3 players out of the ten that are ranked in the top ten, followed by Manchester City and Barcelona with 2 players each and no top ranked players from Inter, Napoli, Tottenham Hotspur, and Liverpool.
